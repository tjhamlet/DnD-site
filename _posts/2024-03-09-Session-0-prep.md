## Hello everyone!
I will be updating this page with resouces for Session #0. 

## Software
Ideally, I would like to use a mix of [Tabletop Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator/) for a virtual tabletop and [dndbeyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) to manage character sheets. You may use whatever tools you best see fit, but I wanted to provide these two since these are the two I will be using.

### Tabletop Simulator mod pack
To increase load times in Tabletop Simulator, I suggest grabbing the mods below. These are the mods that I will be using on the table, so having them downloaded locally will help to prevent you from needing them to be downlaoded upon connecting.

*This still needs to be aggregated*
